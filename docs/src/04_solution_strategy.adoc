== Solution Strategy

=== Introduction and Purpose
We chose to build upon last year's base application, selecting technologies that we were most comfortable with and that aligned well with the project requirements. The application consists of a web-based platform where users can register, compete against others, and answer questions. Additionally, it integrates a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide hints and assist users in responding to quiz questions.

This section outlines the key architectural decisions and strategies that shape the system, including technology choices, architectural patterns, and approaches to achieving the system's quality goals.

=== Technology Decisions
* **Architecture:** Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
* **Backend:** Spring Boot for API development and business logic.
* **Frontend:** Thymeleaf for dynamic rendering within the MVC framework.
* **Database:** HSQLDB for structured data storage.
* **Authentication:** Spring Security with JWT for secure access control.
* **Hosting & Deployment:** Docker and Docker Compose to ensure scalable, consistent, and efficient application deployment across environments.
* **Integration:** Wikidata API for question generation and an external LLM API for hints.

=== System Decomposition
The application follows an MVC architecture with clearly defined layers:

* **Model Layer:** Represents the data and business logic.
* **View Layer:** Uses Thymeleaf templates for rendering dynamic content.
* **Controller Layer:** Manages requests and responses, handling business logic with Spring Boot.
* **Database:** Stores user data, questions, and game history in PostgreSQL.
* **LLM Integration:** Provides AI-generated hints via an external API.
* **External APIs:** Wikidata for question data and third-party services for deployment.

=== Strategies for Quality Goals
[options="header"]
|===
| Priority | Quality Goal | Strategy
| Medium    | Scalability  | Load balancing, database connection pooling, and optimized queries.
| High     | Performance  | Asynchronous processing with Spring Boot and caching mechanisms.
| High     | Security     | Spring Security, encrypted storage, and role-based access control.
| Medium   | Availability | Deployment of the server on Azure Cloud Services for easy distribution over the internet, with control over when the server is active.
| Medium   | Maintainability | Modular architecture with well-documented Spring Boot services.

=== Organizational Decisions
* **Development Process:** Agile methodology with Scrum.
* **Collaboration Tools:** GitHub for version control and GitHub kanban for work distribution.
* **Testing Strategy:** Unit tests with JUnit and integration tests with Selenium + Cucumber.

=== Justification
These decisions ensure that the system is **scalable, secure, and maintainable**, leveraging Spring Boot's powerful ecosystem for **enterprise-grade applications** while integrating **AI-powered hints and automated question generation**.

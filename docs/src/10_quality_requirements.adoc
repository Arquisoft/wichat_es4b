| Quality Requirement | Description
| link:#usage-scenarios-efficiency[**Efficiency**] | The system should ensure fast user access, smooth navigation, quick game interactions, optimized image loading, and efficient generation of questions, LLM responses, and API data to provide a seamless experience.
| link:#usage-scenarios-usability[**Usability**] | The application should be intuitive and accessible to a broad audience, supporting seamless navigation and interaction.
| link:#change-scenarios-maintainability[**Maintainability**] | The system must allow easy extension and modification to accommodate new features and improvements.
| link:#usage-scenarios-availability[**Availability**] | The system should maintain at least 95% uptime, ensuring users can access the application reliably.
| link:#usage-scenarios-reliability[**Reliability**] | The system should minimize errors or failures and provide consistent and accurate results to users.
| link:#usage-scenarios-internationalization[**Internationalization**] | The application should support multiple languages and cultural adaptations for a global audience.
| link:#change-scenarios-scalability[**Scalability**] | The system should be capable of handling increasing loads efficiently.
| link:#change-scenarios-testability[**Testability**] | The system should support automated testing to facilitate quality assurance and reduce errors.
| link:#usage-scenarios-security[**Security**] | The system ensures that only registered users can access their data. API keys are private and user-specific. Personal data is protected, ensuring only authorized users can view their private information.

==== Usage Scenarios

[options="header"]
|===
| **Scenario Category** | **Scenario** | **System Response**
| [[usage-scenarios-efficiency]] Efficiency | The user selects a game mode from the main page. | The system retrieves and presents the relevant questions and answers efficiently.
| [[usage-scenarios-usability]] Usability | A new user starts using the application. | Due to the intuitive design, they quickly understand how to register and navigate.
| [[usage-scenarios-availability]] Availability | Users attempt to access the system during peak hours. | The system remains accessible with minimal latency.
| [[usage-scenarios-reliability]] Reliability | The system processes a high volume of requests simultaneously. | The application maintains stability and processes requests accurately.
| [[usage-scenarios-resilience]] Resilience | A server fails during operation. | The system automatically redirects traffic and continues operation with minimal impact.
| [[usage-scenarios-internationalization]] Internationalization | A user selects a different language preference. | The interface updates accordingly, including translated content and localized settings.
| [[usage-scenarios-security]] Security | A user logs in to the system. | The system ensures the user is authenticated before granting access to private data and API keys.

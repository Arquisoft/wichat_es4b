== Context and Scope

=== Business Context

WIChat is an interactive web-based quiz game application, inspired by "Saber y Ganar".
Users can register, log in, and play the game, where they are presented with images and have to guess the associated place or object.
The novelty lies in the integration of a conversational language model (LLM), which allows users to interact with the game and get hints for the answers dynamically.
The questions and images are generated from Wikidata, providing an automated, real-time experience.

==== Involved Actors

* **User**: Person who accesses the application to play one of the multiple games, review their history, manage their data, etc.
* **Administrator**: Responsible for managing system infrastructure and security.
* **WebApp**:Main interface of the system that connects with internal services.
* **Database**: MySQL used to store user information, game history, and question data.
* **External APIs**: External service used to retrieve image and metadata for question generation, provides AI-generated quiz questions and hints, etc.
* **External developers**: Developers who interact with the API to retrieve and modify player data, questions, and game history.

=== Technical Context

The system consists of several services developed in Java using Spring Boot, utilizing Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
The frontend is developed using HTML, and the backend communicates through direct method calls for internal service interactions, while external communication is handled via REST API over HTTPS.
A relational database (MySQL) is used for data persistence
